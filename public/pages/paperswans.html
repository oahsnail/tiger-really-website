            Hey there! ٩(•̤̀ᵕ•̤́๑)
        </h1>
        <br />
        <h3>
            If you're reading this, you must have picked up and scanned a paper swan!
            Thank you for being a curious little freak >:) I won't waste your time, here's
            Why I made these paper swans and scattered them around campus.
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            I'm Lian, and I just graduated UBC a few months ago. Over the last couple
            years I've learned a lot. Some stuff about my major, but mostly about love.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I've learned that love is beautiful, but it sucks SO BAD when it
            turns into grief. You meet someone, they push all of infinity through you 
            and your life, and then it's over, and things are never the same ever again.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I've learned that grief is a transformative force, and that in order to
            heal, you have to let it change you. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In order to cope with the enormity of emotions that come with love and grief,
            I've been writing songs about love. Songs about the people I've loved, and 
            the ways that love has changed me, for better or for worse. Eventually,
            enough people started listening to these songs that I decided to put all of
            them together into an album, and even got a record label to help me release it.

            This album is called Swan Sting, and it's sort of the story of the last 3 
            very strange years of my life. This is also why there's a origami swan in your
            hands right now.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Every song on the album is directly inspired 
            by a personal experience I’ve had during it. They’re not necessarily 
            grandiose or unique experiences, they're mine. 
            I did my best to portray how I felt in these times, 
            and I hope listening to Swan Sting lets you feel the same. 
            What you do with the stories is up to you, but my hope is that these songs 
            help you reflect on and process your own experiences, and see beauty in the 
            irreplaceable person they shaped.
