    <h1>Official Bio:</h1>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>
            Starting out as a stupid pun on the name of a flower, Tiger Really has since
            transformed from a bedroom project to one of the most exciting and unique bands
            the Vancouver scene has to offer. Fronted by songwriter/multi-instrumentalist
            Lian Shao, the band has carved out a niche for themselves by mixing emo with
            elements of jazz, punk, and indie rock, creating a sound that is both distinct
            and deeply resonant.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since signing with legendary emo label Counter Intuitive Records in 2023,
            Tiger Really has built a dedicated global audience through social media and
            word of mouth, alongside performing frequent local shows and sharing stages with
            some of the genre's most influential touring acts including 'Michael Cera Palin',
            'Chinese Football', 'Weatherday' and 'Your Arms Are My Cocoon'. Their consistently electrifying
            performances coupled with Lian's intensely personal songwriting has garnered them
            a deeply connected fan base and community, cementing themselves as a staple
            of the Vancouver underground.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tiger Really is set to release their highly anticipated debut full length
            album "Swan Sting" on October 18th 2024 through Counter Intuitive records.
