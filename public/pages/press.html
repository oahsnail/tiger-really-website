    <h1>Official Bio:</h1>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        Starting out as a stupid pun on the name of a flower, Tiger Really has since 
        transformed from a bedroom project to one of the most exciting and unique bands 
        the Vancouver scene has to offer. Fronted by songwriter/multi-instrumentalist 
        Lian Shao, the band has carved out a niche for themselves by mixing emo with 
        elements of jazz, punk, and indie rock, creating a sound that is both distinct 
        and deeply resonant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since signing with legendary emo label Counter Intuitive Records in 2023, 
        Tiger Really has built a dedicated global audience through social media and 
        word of mouth, as well as cemented themselves as a staple of the Vancouver 
        underground, performing frequent local shows as well as sharing stages with 
        some of the genre's most influential touring acts including 'Michael Cera Palin' 
        and 'Your Arms Are My Cocoon'. Their consistently electrifying live shows and 
        their ability to connect with their audiences have also earned them spots at 
        festivals such as Khatsahlano and Burnaby Canada Day Street Fest, as well as 
        an incredibly well-received headlining show at the Hollywood Theatre.

        Tiger Really is set to release their highly anticipated debut full length 
        album "Swan Sting" in late 2024 with Counter Intuitive records.
